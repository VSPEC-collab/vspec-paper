We obtain significantly improved fits to the infrared spectrum of the M dwarf VB10 when compared to earlier models. H2O is by far the dominant opacity source in cool stars. To illustrate this, we show the Rosseland mean of the total extinction under various assumptions. Our calculations demonstrate the importance of a good treatment of the water opacities in cool stars and the improvements possible by using up-to-date data for the water line absorption.},

  abstract = {Brown dwarf atmospheres form molecules, then high temperature condensates (corundum, titanates, silicates, and iron compounds), and then low temperature condensates (ices) as they cool down over time. These produce large opacities which govern entirely their spectral energy distribution. Just as it is important to know molecular opacities (TiO, H\_2O, CH\_4, etc.) with accuracy, it is imperative to understand the interplay of processes (e.g. condensation, sedimentation, coagulation, convection) that determines the radial and size distribution of grains. Limiting case models have shown that young, hot brown (L) dwarfs form dust mostly in equilibrium, while at much cooler stages (late T dwarfs) all high temperature condensates have sedimented out of their photospheres. But this process is gradual and all intermediate classes of brown dwarfs can partly be understood in terms of partial sedimentation of dust. With new models accounting for these processes, we describe the effects they may have upon brown dwarf spectral properties.},

  abstract = {Context: T-type dwarfs present a broad and shallow absorption feature centred around 6950 {\AA} in the blue wing of the K doublet at 0.77 {$\mu$}m which resembles in depth and shape the satellite absorption predicted by detailed collisional broadening profiles. In our previous work, the position of the predicted line satellite was however somewhat too blue compared to the observed feature. Aims: In this paper, we investigate whether new calculations of the energy surfaces of the potentials in the K-H2 system, including spin-orbit coupling, result in a closer coincidence of the satellite with the observed position. We also investigate the extent to which CaH absorption bands contribute to the feature and at what T\_eff these respective opacity sources predominate. Methods: We present model atmospheres and synthetic spectra, including gravitational settling for an improved description of depth-dependent abundances of refractory elements, and based on new K-H2 line profiles using improved interaction potentials. Results: By comparison with a high signal-to-noise optical spectrum of the T1 dwarf {\textbackslash}varepsilon Indi Ba, we find that these new models do reproduce the observed feature, while CaH does not contribute for the atmospheric parameters considered. We also find that CaH is settled out so deep into the atmosphere that even turbulent vertical mixing would appear insufficient to bring significant amounts of CaH to the observable photosphere in dwarfs of later type than L5. Conclusions: We conclude that previous identification of the feature at this location in the spectra of T dwarfs as well as the latest L dwarfs with CaH was erroneous, as expected on physical grounds: calcium has already condensed onto grains in early L dwarfs and thus should have settled out of the photosphere in cooler brown dwarfs. This finding revokes one of the observational verifications for the cloud-clearing theory assumption: a gradual clearing of the cloud cover in early T dwarfs.},

This paper describes a maximum-likelihood method for estimating the model parameters (based on the observed power spectrum statistics) that accounts for redistribution of spectral power caused by gaps in the data string, by convolving the model with the power spectrum of the observed window function. The accuracy and reliability of the method were tested using both artificial and authentic solar oscillation power spectrum data. A comparison of this method with various least-squares techniques is also presented.},

  abstract = {Transmission spectroscopy of transiting exoplanets is a proven technique that can yield information on the composition and structure of a planet's atmosphere. However, transmission spectra may be compromised by inhomogeneities in the stellar photosphere. The sub-Neptune-sized habitable zone planet K2-18b has water absorption detected in its atmosphere using data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Herein, we examine whether the reported planetary atmospheric signal seen from HST transmission spectroscopy of K2-18b could instead be induced by time-varying starspots. We built a time-variable spectral model of K2-18 that is designed to match the variability amplitude seen in K2 photometric data, and we used this model to simulate 1000 HST data sets that follow the K2-18b observation strategy. More than 1\% of these provide a better fit to the data than the best-fitting exoplanet atmosphere model. After resampling our simulations to generate synthetic HST observations, we find that 40\% of random draws would produce an atmospheric detection at a level at least as significant as that seen in the actual HST data of K2-18b. This work illustrates that the inferred detection of an atmosphere on K2-18b may alternatively be explained by stellar spectral contamination due to the inhomogeneous photosphere of K2-18. We do not rule out a detection of water in the planet's atmosphere, but we provide a plausible alternative that should be considered and conclude that more observations are needed to fully rule out stellar contamination.},

As one of the closest known transiting multi-planet systems, L 98-59 offers one of the best opportunities to probe and compare the atmospheres of rocky planets that formed in the same stellar environment. We measured the transmission spectrum of L 98-59 c during a single transit, with the extracted spectrum showing marginal evidence for wavelength-dependent transit depth variations which would indicate the presence of an atmosphere. Forward modeling was used to constrain possible atmospheric compositions of the planet based on the shape of the transmission spectrum. Although L 98-59 is a fairly quiet star, we have seen evidence for stellar activity, and therefore we cannot rule out a scenario where the source of the signal originates with inhomogeneities on the host-star surface. While intriguing, our results are inconclusive and additional data is needed to verify any atmospheric signal. Fortunately, additional data will soon be collected from both HST and JWST. Should this result be confirmed with additional data, L 98-59 c would be the first planet smaller than 2 Earth-radii with a detected atmosphere, and among the first small planets with a known atmosphere to be studied in detail by the JWST.},

  abstract = {Over 24,000 measurements of individual sunspot umbral areas taken from the Mount Wilson white-light plate collection covering the period 1917-1982 are used to determine the relative size distribution of sunspot umbras. In the range 1.5-141 millionths of a solar hemisphere, the sunspot umbral areas are found to be distributed lognormally. Moreover, the same distribution is obtained for all phases of the solar cycle (maximum, minimum, ascending, descending), as well as for various individual cycles, between 1917 and 1982. Both the mean and the geometric logarithmic standard deviation of this distribution appear to be intrinsically constant over the entire data set; only the number of spots exhibits the familiar solar cycle variations. If the observed lognormal umbral size distribution is not a particular attribute of the sunspot umbras but is instead of a more fundamental property of emerging magnetic flux, then the data would predict a maximum in the size spectrum of photospheric magnetic structures for flux tubes with radii in the range 500-800 km. The absence of solar cycle variations in the relative distribution of umbral areas and especially the lognormal character of this distribution may both argue for the fragmentation of magnetic elements in the solar envelope.},

At 1.730 {\textpm} 0.025 R {$\oplus$}, LHS 1140 b falls within the radius valley separating H2-rich mini-Neptunes from rocky super-Earths. Recent mass and radius revisions indicate a bulk density significantly lower than expected for an Earth-like rocky interior, suggesting that LHS 1140 b could be either a mini-Neptune with a small envelope of hydrogen ({$\sim$}0.1\% by mass) or a water world (9\%--19\% water by mass). Atmospheric characterization through transmission spectroscopy can readily discern between these two scenarios. Here we present two JWST/NIRISS transit observations of LHS 1140 b, one of which captures a serendipitous transit of LHS 1140 c. The combined transmission spectrum of LHS 1140 b shows a telltale spectral signature of unocculted faculae (5.8{$\sigma$}), covering {$\sim$}20\% of the visible stellar surface. Besides faculae, our spectral retrieval analysis reveals tentative evidence of residual spectral features, best fit by Rayleigh scattering from a N2-dominated atmosphere (2.3{$\sigma$}), irrespective of the consideration of atmospheric hazes. We also show through Global Climate Models (GCMs) that H2-rich atmospheres of various compositions (100{\texttimes}, 300{\texttimes}, 1000{\texttimes} solar metallicity) are ruled out to {$>$}10{$\sigma$}. The GCM calculations predict that water clouds form below the transit photosphere, limiting their impact on transmission data. Our observations suggest that LHS 1140 b is either airless or, more likely, surrounded by an atmosphere with a high mean molecular weight. Our tentative evidence of a N2-rich atmosphere provides strong motivation for future transmission spectroscopy observations of LHS 1140 b.},

We present phase variations for a variety of different radiative times and wind speeds. In the limit of instant re-radiation, the light-curve morphology is entirely dictated by the planet's eccentricity and argument of pericenter: the light curve maximum leads or trails the eclipse depending on whether the planet is receding from or approaching the star at superior conjunction, respectively. For a planet with non-zero radiative timescales, the phase peak occurs early for super-rotating winds, and late for sub-rotating winds. We find that for a circular orbit, the timing of the phase variation maximum with respect to superior conjunction indicates the direction of the dominant winds, but cannot break the degeneracy between wind speed and radiative time. For circular planets the phase minimum occurs half an orbit away from the phase maximum---despite the fact that the coolest longitudes are always near the dawn terminator---and therefore does not convey any additional information. In general, increasing the advective frequency or the radiative time has the effect of reducing the peak-to-trough amplitude of phase variations, but there are interesting exceptions to these trends. Lastly, eccentric planets with orbital periods significantly longer than their radiative time exhibit "ringing," whereby the hot spot generated at periastron rotates in and out of view. The existence of ringing makes it possible to directly measure the wind speed (the frequency of the ringing) and the radiative time constant (the damping of the ringing).},

The final sample contains 851,168 candidate flare events recovered above the 68\% completeness threshold, which were detected from 4041 stars, or 1.9\% of the stars in the Kepler database. The average flare energy detected is {$\sim$}1035 erg. The net fraction of flare stars increases with g - I color, or decreasing stellar mass. For stars in this sample with previously measured rotation periods, the total relative flare luminosity is compared to the Rossby number. A tentative detection of flare activity saturation for low-mass stars with rapid rotation below a Rossby number of {$\sim$}0.03 is found. A power-law decay in flare activity with Rossby number is found with a slope of -1, shallower than typical measurements for X-ray activity decay with Rossby number.},

  abstract = {Limb darkening is fundamental in determining transit light-curve shapes, and is typically modelled by a variety of laws that parametrize the intensity profile of the star that is being transited. Confronted with a transit light curve, some authors fix the parameters of these laws, the so-called limb darkening coefficients (LDCs), while others prefer to let them float in the light-curve fitting procedure. Which of these is the best strategy, however, is still unclear, as well as how and by how much each of these can bias the retrieved transit parameters. In this work we attempt to clarify those points by first recalculating these LDCs, comparing them to measured values from Kepler transit light curves using an algorithm that takes into account uncertainties in both the geometry of the transit and the parameters of the stellar host. We show there are significant departures from predicted model values, suggesting that our understanding of limb darkening still needs to improve. Then, we show through simulations that if one uses the quadratic limb darkening law to parametrize limb darkening, fixing and fitting the LDCs can lead to significant biases - up to {$\sim$}3 and {$\sim$}1 per cent in Rp/R*, respectively - which are important for several confirmed and candidate exoplanets. We conclude that, in this case, the best approach is to let the LDCs be free in the fitting procedure. Strategies to avoid biases in data from present and future missions involving high precision measurements of transit parameters are described.},

  abstract = {The habitability of planets is closely connected with stellar activity, mainly the frequency of flares and the distribution of flare energy. Kepler and TESS find many flaring stars via precise time-domain photometric data, and the frequency and energy distribution of stellar flares on different types of stars are studied statistically. However, the completeness and observational bias of detected flare events from different missions (e.g., Kepler and TESS) vary a lot. We use a unified data processing and detection method for flare events based on the light curves from Kepler and TESS. Then we perform injection and recovery tests in the original light curve of each star for each flare event to correct the completeness and energy of flares. Three samples of flaring stars are selected from Kepler and TESS, with rotation periods from 1 to {\textasciitilde}5 days. Adopting a hot-blackbody assumption, our results show that the cumulative flare frequency distributions (FFDs) of the same stars in Kepler and TESS bands tend to be consistent after correction, revealing a more natural flaring frequency and energy distribution. Our results also extend the low-energy limit in cumulative FFD fitting to 1031.5-33 erg on different types of stars. For solar-type stars, the average power-law index of cumulative FFD ({$\alpha$} cum) is -0.84, which indicates that low-energy flares contribute less to the total flare energy. With a piecewise correlation between {$\alpha$} cum and T eff, {$\alpha$} cum first rises from M2 to K1 stars, then slightly decreases for stars hotter than K1.},

  abstract = {Aims: TRAPPIST-1 is a nearby ultra-cool dwarf star transited by seven rocky planets. We observed three transits of its outermost planet, TRAPPIST-1h, using the G141 grism of the Wide Field Camera 3 instrument aboard the Hubble Space Telescope to place constraints on its potentially cold atmosphere. Methods: In order to deal with the effect of stellar contamination, we model TRAPPIST-1 active regions as portions of a cooler and a hotter photosphere, and generate multi-temperature models that we compare to the out-of-transit spectrum of the star. Using the inferred spot parameters, we produce corrected transmission spectra for planet h under five transit configurations and compare these data to planetary atmospheric transmission models using the forward model CHIMERA. Results: Our analysis reveals that TRAPPIST-1h is unlikely to host an aerosol-free H/He-dominated atmosphere. While the current data precision limits the constraints we can put on the planetary atmosphere, we find that the likeliest scenario is that of a flat, featureless transmission spectrum in the WFC3/G141 bandpass due to a high mean molecular weight atmosphere ({$\geq$}1000 {\texttimes} solar), no atmosphere, or an opaque aerosol layer, all in absence of stellar contamination. This work outlines the limitations of modeling active photospheric regions with theoretical stellar spectra, and those brought by our lack of knowledge of the photospheric structure of ultracool dwarf stars. Further characterization of the planetary atmosphere of TRAPPIST-1h would require higher precision measurements over wider wavelengths, which will be possible with the James Webb Space Telescope.},

In particular, GPs are frequently employed to account for correlated stellar variability in planetary transit light curves. The efficient application of GPs to light curves containing thousands to tens of thousands of data points has been made possible by recent advances in GP methods, including the celerite method. Here we present an extension of the celerite method to two input dimensions where, typically, the second dimension is small. This method scales linearly with the total number of data points when the noise in each large dimension is proportional to the same celerite kernel and only the amplitude of the correlated noise varies in the second dimension. We demonstrate the application of this method to the problem of measuring precise transit parameters from multiwavelength light curves and show that it has the potential to improve transit parameters measurements by orders of magnitude. Applications of this method include transit spectroscopy and exomoon detection, as well a broader set of astronomical problems.},

  abstract = {Polar faculae are the footpoints of magnetic-field lines near the Sun's poles that are seen as bright regions along the edges of granules. The time variation in the number of polar faculae has been shown to correlate with the strength of the polar magnetic field and to be a predictor of the subsequent solar cycle. Due to the small size and transient nature of these features, combined with different techniques and observational factors, previous counts of polar faculae differ in magnitude. Further, there were no scalable techniques to measure the statistical properties of the faculae, such as the variation of the facular lifetime with time or solar activity. Using data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we present two new methods for tracking faculae and measuring their properties. In the first, we calculate the pixel-by-pixel standard deviation of the HMI continuum intensity images over one day, visualizing the faculae as streaks. The lifetime of the facula is found by dividing the angular length of the streaks by the latitude-dependent rotation rate. We apply this method to the more visible pole each day for a week every six months, from September 2010 to March 2021. Combining all of the measured facular lifetimes provides a statistical distribution with a mean of 6.0 hours, a FWHM of 5.4 hours, and a skew towards longer lifetimes, with some faculae lasting up to 1 day. In the second method, we overlay images of the progressive standard deviation with the HMI magnetogram to show the close relationship between the facular candidates and the magnetic field. The results of this method allow us to distinguish between motion due to the Sun's rotation and "proper motion" due to faculae moving across the Sun's surface, confirming that faculae participate in convective motions at the poles. Counts of polar faculae using both methods agree with previous counts in their variation with the solar cycle and the polar magnetic field. These methods can be extended to automate the identification and measurement of other properties of polar faculae, which would allow for daily measurements of all faculae since SDO began operation in 2010.},

  abstract = {Context. The long and almost continuous observations by Kepler show clear evidence of a granulation background signal in a large sample of stars, which is interpreted as the surface manifestation of convection. It has been shown that its characteristic timescale and rms intensity fluctuation scale with the peak frequency ({$\nu$}max) of the solar-like oscillations. Various attempts have been made to quantify the observed signal, to determine scaling relations for its characteristic parameters, and to compare them to theoretical predictions. Even though they are consistent on a global scale, large systematic differences of an unknown origin remain between different methods, as well as between the observations and simulations. Aims: We aim to study different approaches to quantifying the signature of stellar granulation and to search for a unified model that reproduces the observed signal best in a wide variety of stars. We then aim to define empirical scaling relations between the granulation properties and {$\nu$}max and various other stellar parameters. Methods: We use a probabilistic method to compare different approaches to extracting the granulation signal. We fit the power density spectra of a large set of Kepler targets, determine the granulation and global oscillation parameter, and quantify scaling relations between them. Results: We establish that a depression in power at about {$\nu$}max/2, known from the Sun and a few other main-sequence stars, is also statistically significant in red giants and that a super-Lorentzian function with two components is best suited to reproducing the granulation signal in the broader vicinity of the pulsation power excess. We also establish that the specific choice of the background model can affect the determination of {$\nu$}max, introducing systematic uncertainties that can significantly exceed the random uncertainties. We find the characteristic frequency (i.e., inverse timescale) and amplitude of both background components to tightly scale with {$\nu$}max for a wide variety of stars (about 2-2000 {$\mu$}Hz in {$\nu$}max), and quantify a mass dependency of the latter. To enable comparison with theoretical predictions (which do not include the observed power depression), we computed effective timescales and bolometric intensity fluctuations and found them to approximately scale as {$\tau$}eff {$\propto$} g-0.85T-0.4 and Agran {$\propto$} (g2M)- 1/4 (or more conveniently R/M3/4), respectively. Similarly, the bolometric pulsation amplitude scales approximately as Apuls {$\propto$} (g2M)- 1/3 (or R4/3/M), which implicitly verifies a separate mass and luminosity dependence of Apuls. We have also checked our scaling relations with solar reference values and find them in good agreement. Conclusions: We provide a thorough analysis of the granulation background signal in a large sample of stars, from which we establish a unified model that allows us to accurately extract the granulation and global oscillation parameter. The resulting scaling relations allow a simple estimate of the overall spectral shape of any solar-type oscillator and might serve as a starting point for future large-sample studies or as a reference for theoretical modelling of granulation.},

Population statistics show that close-in planets in this size range bifurcate into two classes on the basis of their radii2,3. It is proposed that the group with larger radii (referred to as `sub-Neptunes') is distinguished by having hydrogen-dominated atmospheres that are a few percent of the total mass of the planets4. GJ 1214b is an archetype sub-Neptune that has been observed extensively using transmission spectroscopy to test this hypothesis5-14. However, the measured spectra are featureless, and thus inconclusive, due to the presence of high-altitude aerosols in the planet's atmosphere. Here we report a spectroscopic thermal phase curve of GJ 1214b obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the mid-infrared. The dayside and nightside spectra (average brightness temperatures of 553 {\textpm} 9 and 437 {\textpm} 19 K, respectively) each show more than 3{$\sigma$} evidence of absorption features, with H2O as the most likely cause in both. The measured global thermal emission implies that GJ 1214b's Bond albedo is 0.51 {\textpm} 0.06. Comparison between the spectroscopic phase curve data and three-dimensional models of GJ 1214b reveal a planet with a high metallicity atmosphere blanketed by a thick and highly reflective layer of clouds or haze.},

The resulting photospheric up- and downflows leave imprints in the observed spectral line profiles. We perform a careful statistical analysis of stellar granulation and its properties for different stellar parameters. We employ realistic 3D radiative hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations of surface convection from the Stagger-grid, a comprehensive grid of atmosphere models that covers a large parameter space in terms of Teff, logg, and [Fe/H]. Individual granules are detected from the (bolometric) intensity maps at disk center with an efficient granulation pattern recognition algorithm. From these we derive their respective properties: diameter, fractal dimension (area-perimeter relation), geometry, topology, variation of intensity, temperature, density and velocity with granule size. Also, the correlation of the physical properties at the optical surface are studied. We find in all of our 3D RHD simulations stellar granulation patterns imprinted, which are qualitatively similar to the solar case, despite the large differences in stellar parameters. The granules exhibit a large range in size, which can be divided into two groups - smaller and larger granules - by the mean granule size. These are distinct in their properties: smaller granules are regular shaped and dimmer, while the larger ones are increasingly irregular and more complex in their shapes and distribution in intensity contrast. This is reflected in their fractal dimensions, which is close to unity for the smaller granules, and close to two for larger granules, which is due to the fragmentation of granules. Stellar surface convection seems to operate scale-invariant over a large range in stellar parameters, which translates into a self-similar stellar granulation pattern.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we explore the evolution of sunspot latitude distribution and explore its relations with the cycle strength. With the progress of the solar cycle, the distributions in two hemispheres from mid-latitudes propagate toward the equator and then (before the usual solar minimum) these two distributions touch each other. By visualizing the evolution of the distributions in two hemispheres, we separate the solar cycles by excluding this hemispheric overlap. From these isolated solar cycles in two hemispheres, we generate latitude distributions for each cycle, starting from cycle 8 to cycle 23. We find that the parameters of these distributions, namely the central latitude (C), width ({$\delta$}), and height (H), evolve with the cycle number, and they show some hemispheric asymmetries. Although the asymmetries in these parameters persist for a few successive cycles, they get corrected within a few cycles, and the new asymmetries appear again. In agreement with the previous study, we find that distribution parameters are correlated with the strengths of the cycles, although these correlations are significantly different in two hemispheres. The general trend features, i.e., (i) stronger cycles that begin sunspot eruptions at relatively higher latitudes, and (ii) stronger cycles that have wider bands of sunspot emergence latitudes, are confirmed when combining the data from two hemispheres. We explore these features using a flux transport dynamo model with stochastic fluctuations. We find that these features are correctly reproduced in this model. The solar cycle evolution of the distribution center is also in good agreement with observations. Possible explanations of the observed features based on this dynamo model are presented.},

  abstract = {Recent investigations have demonstrated the potential for utilizing a new observational and data-analysis technique for studying the atmospheres of nontransiting exoplanets with combined light that relies on acquiring simultaneous, broad-wavelength spectra and resolving planetary infrared emission from the stellar spectrum through simultaneous fitting of the stellar and planetary spectral signatures. This new data-analysis technique, called planetary infrared excess (PIE), holds the potential to open up the opportunity for measuring mid-infrared (MIR) phase curves of nontransiting rocky planets around the nearest stars with a relatively modest telescope aperture. We present simulations of the performance and science yield for a mission and instrument concept that we call the MIR Exoplanet CLimate Explorer, a concept for a moderately sized cryogenic telescope with broad wavelength coverage (1-18 {$\mu$}m) and a low-resolution (R {\textasciitilde} 50) spectrograph designed for the simultaneous wavelength coverage and extreme flux measurement precision necessary to detect the emission from cool rocky planets with PIE. We present exploratory simulations of the potential science yield for PIE measurements of the nearby planet Proxima Centauri b, showing the potential to measure the composition and structure of an Earth-like atmosphere with a relatively modest observing time. We also present overall science yields for several mission architecture and performance metrics, and discuss the technical performance requirements and potential telescope and instrument technologies that could meet these requirements.},

  abstract = {Planets orbiting M-dwarf stars are prime targets in the search for rocky exoplanet atmospheres. The small size of M dwarfs renders their planets exceptional targets for transmission spectroscopy, facilitating atmospheric characterization. However, it remains unknown whether their host stars' highly variable extreme-UV radiation environments allow atmospheres to persist. With JWST, we have begun to determine whether or not the most favorable rocky worlds orbiting M dwarfs have detectable atmospheres. Here, we present a 2.8-5.2 {$\mu$}m JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectrum of the warm (700 K, 40.3{\texttimes} Earth's insolation) super-Earth GJ 486b (1.3 R {$\oplus$} and 3.0 M {$\oplus$}). The measured spectrum from our two transits of GJ 486b deviates from a flat line at 2.2{$\sigma$} - 3.3{$\sigma$}, based on three independent reductions. Through a combination of forward and retrieval models, we determine that GJ 486b either has a water-rich atmosphere (with the most stringent constraint on the retrieved water abundance of H2O {$>$} 10\% to 2{$\sigma$}) or the transmission spectrum is contaminated by water present in cool unocculted starspots. We also find that the measured stellar spectrum is best fit by a stellar model with cool starspots and hot faculae. While both retrieval scenarios provide equal quality fits ( \$\{{\textbackslash}chi \}\_\{{\textbackslash}nu \}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}=1.0\$ ) to our NIRSpec/G395H observations, shorter wavelength observations can break this degeneracy and reveal if GJ 486b sustains a water-rich atmosphere.},

  abstract = {The discovery of a large number of terrestrial exoplanets in the habitable zones of their stars, many of which are qualitatively different from Earth, has led to a growing need for fast and flexible 3D climate models, which could model such planets and explore multiple possible climate states and surface conditions. We respond to that need by creating ExoPlaSim, a modified version of the Planet Simulator (PlaSim) that is designed to be applicable to synchronously rotating terrestrial planets, planets orbiting stars with non-solar spectra, and planets with non-Earth-like surface pressures. In this paper, we describe our modifications, present validation tests of ExoPlaSim's performance against other GCMs, and demonstrate its utility by performing two simple experiments involving hundreds of models. We find that ExoPlaSim agrees qualitatively with more-sophisticated GCMs such as ExoCAM, LMDG, and ROCKE-3D, falling within the ensemble distribution on multiple measures. The model is fast enough that it enables large parameter surveys with hundreds to thousands of models, potentially enabling the efficient use of a 3D climate model in retrievals of future exoplanet observations. We describe our efforts to make ExoPlaSim accessible to non-modellers, including observers, non-computational theorists, students, and educators through a new Python API and streamlined installation through pip, along with online documentation.},

  abstract = {Transmission spectra are differential measurements that utilize stellar illumination to probe transiting exoplanet atmospheres. Any spectral difference between the illuminating light source and the disk-integrated stellar spectrum due to starspots and faculae will be imprinted in the observed transmission spectrum. However, few constraints exist for the extent of photospheric heterogeneities in M dwarfs. Here we model spot and faculae covering fractions consistent with observed photometric variabilities for M dwarfs and the associated 0.3-5.5 {$\mu$}m stellar contamination spectra. We find that large ranges of spot and faculae covering fractions are consistent with observations and corrections assuming a linear relation between variability amplitude, and covering fractions generally underestimate the stellar contamination. Using realistic estimates for spot and faculae covering fractions, we find that stellar contamination can be more than 10{\texttimes} larger than the transit depth changes expected for atmospheric features in rocky exoplanets. We also find that stellar spectral contamination can lead to systematic errors in radius and therefore the derived density of small planets. In the case of the TRAPPIST-1 system, we show that TRAPPIST-1's rotational variability is consistent with spot covering fractions \{f\}\{spot\}=\{8\}-7+18 \% and faculae covering fractions \{f\}\{fac\}=\{54\}-46+16 \% . The associated stellar contamination signals alter the transit depths of the TRAPPIST-1 planets at wavelengths of interest for planetary atmospheric species by roughly 1-15{\texttimes} the strength of planetary features, significantly complicating JWST follow-up observations of this system. Similarly, we find that stellar contamination can lead to underestimates of the bulk densities of the TRAPPIST-1 planets of \{\{{$\Delta$} \}\}({$\rho$} )=-\{8\}-20+7 \% , thus leading to overestimates of their volatile contents.},

  abstract = {Field configurations and temperature distributions of axially symmetric fluxtubes are determined on the basis of pressure equilibrium and energy balance of the tubes. The description concentrates on layers below {$\approx$} 600 km above the photosphere; a magnetostatic field, and energy transport by a diffusion process are assumed. It is assumed also that the magnetic field of the tubes prevents convective flow across the field lines, so that only radiative energy exchange between the tube and the convection zone is present. A set of model tubes is presented ranging in size from facular points (150 km) to small pores (1000 km), for different values of the field amplitude and the asymptotic energy flux F0 flowing along the tube from the deeper layers. Radial influx of heat into the tube at the photospheric level influences the temperature in the tube strongly for all these models. For a pore-like tube f0 = 0.25 (similar to the flux from a spot umbra) seems appropriate (F0 in units of the normal photospheric flux). If in the smallest fluxtubes F0 is also 0.25, a comparison of the intensity contrast with observations of facular points indicates that the radius of tubes corresponding to facular points is 50-100 km. In the continuum the structure looks like a depression in the photosphere (similar to the Wilson depression of spots). The magnitude of this depression is {$\approx$} 200 km for pores of 1000 km diameter and {$\approx$} 100 km for facular points. The walls of the hole created by the depression contribute considerably to the contrast of structures observed near the solar limb. It is shown how this contribution may explain the centre to limb behaviour of facular contrast as seen in the continuum, and why the continuum CLV differs so strongly from that in line cores. Over the first 400 km above the photosphere the tube expands by a factor of {$\approx$} 2 for all the tubes calculated.},

  abstract = {To date, the ability for observers to reveal the composition or thermal structure of an exoplanet's atmosphere has rested on two techniques: high-contrast direct imaging and time-series observations of transiting exoplanets. The former is currently limited to characterizing young, massive objects while the latter requires near 90{$^\circ$} orbital inclinations, thus limiting atmospheric studies to a small fraction of the total exoplanet population. Here we present an observational and analysis technique for studying the atmospheres of non-transiting exoplanets that relies on acquiring simultaneous, broad-wavelength spectra and resolving planetary infrared emission from the stellar spectrum. This method could provide an efficient means to study exoplanet atmospheric dynamics using sparsely sampled phase curve observations or a mechanism to search for signs of life on non-transiting exoplanets orbiting the nearest M-dwarf stars (such as Proxima Centauri). If shown to be effective with James Webb Space Telescope observations, the method of measuring planetary infrared excess would open up the large population of nearby, non-transiting exoplanets for atmospheric characterization.},

  abstract = {Observations obtained at the Swedish Solar Observatory, La Palma, using the Lockheed tunable filter, have been used to measure properties of active region faculae, including contrast from disk center to near the limb. The data consist of coregistered digital photometric images of the line-of-sight magnetic field and of the continuum intensity. The results are related to the structure of the individual flux tubes comprising faculae in active regions. In addition to center-limb contrast, the observations reveal a change in contrast between heliocentric angles of about 45{$^\circ$} and 60{$^\circ$} related to the ``turn-on'' of bright faculae. A class of models has been constructed that describes a facula as an evacuated thin flux tube with a hot wall and a depressed cool floor (hot wall model). The hot wall model is very successful in predicting the observations, including the changes observed between 45{$^\circ$} and 60{$^\circ$}. The model predicts that the larger flux tubes comprising active region plage are micropores with a Wilson depression of 100 km largely independent of micropore diameter. Their typical diameter is 350-650 km; the largest ones are about 1200 km across. Bright points are the major component of active region plages by number, but micropores probably are the major component by total magnetic flux. Bright active region faculae seen near the limb are simply micropores viewed from the side, where the hot wall is visible and the depressed cool floor is not. The temperature difference between cool floor and hot wall varies from 300 to nearly 500 K, depending on tube diameter and heliocentric angle. These results have important implications for solar irradiance variations.},

This is achieved by combining several state-of-the-art radiative transfer models, spectroscopic databases and planetary databases (i.e., climatological and orbital). PSG has a 3D (three-dimensional) orbital calculator for most bodies in the solar system, and all confirmed exoplanets, while the radiative-transfer models can ingest billions of spectral signatures for hundreds of species from several spectroscopic repositories. It integrates the latest radiative-transfer and scattering methods in order to compute high resolution spectra via line-by-line calculations, and utilizes the efficient correlated-k method at moderate resolutions, while for computing cometary spectra, PSG handles non-LTE and LTE excitation processes. PSG includes a realistic noise calculator that integrates several telescope/instrument configurations (e.g., interferometry, coronagraphs) and detector technologies (e.g., CCD, heterodyne detectors, bolometers). Such an integration of advanced spectroscopic methods into an online tool can greatly serve the planetary community, ultimately enabling the retrieval of planetary parameters from remote sensing data, efficient mission planning strategies, interpretation of current and future planetary data, calibration of spectroscopic data, and development of new instrument/spacecraft concepts.},

One of the core models studied as part of THAI is ExoCAM, an independently curated exoplanet branch of the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Earth System Model (CESM), version 1.2.1. ExoCAM has been used for studying atmospheres of terrestrial extrasolar planets around a variety of stars. To accompany the THAI project and provide a primary reference, here we describe ExoCAM and what makes it unique from standard configurations of CESM. Furthermore, we also conduct a series of intramodel sensitivity tests of relevant moist physical tuning parameters while using the THAI protocol as our starting point. A common criticism of 3D climate models used for exoplanet modeling is that cloud and convection routines often contain free parameters that are tuned to the modern Earth, and thus may be a source of uncertainty in evaluating exoplanet climates. Here, we explore sensitivities to numerous configuration and parameter selections, including a recently updated radiation scheme, a different cloud and convection physics package, different cloud and precipitation tuning parameters, and a different sea ice albedo. Improvements to our radiation scheme and the modification of cloud particle sizes have the largest effects on global mean temperatures, with variations up to {\textasciitilde}10 K, highlighting the requirement for accurate radiative transfer and the importance of cloud microphysics for simulating exoplanetary climates. However, for the vast majority of sensitivity tests, climate differences are small. For all cases studied, intramodel differences do not bias general conclusions regarding climate states and habitability.},
