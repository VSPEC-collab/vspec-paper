  abstract = {Transmission spectroscopy during planetary transits is expected to be a major source of information on the atmospheres of small (approximately Earth-sized) exoplanets in the next two decades. This technique, however, is intrinsically affected by stellar spectral contamination caused by the fact that stellar photo- and chromospheres are not perfectly homogeneous. Such stellar contamination will often reach or exceed the signal introduced by the planetary spectral features. Finding effective methods to correct stellar contamination -- or at least to quantify its possible range -- for the most important exoplanets is a necessary step for our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres. This will require significantly deepening our understanding of stellar heterogeneity, which is currently limited by the available data.},

  abstract = {Transmission spectroscopy of transiting exoplanets is a proven technique that can yield information on the composition and structure of a planet's atmosphere. However, transmission spectra may be compromised by inhomogeneities in the stellar photosphere. The sub-Neptune-sized habitable zone planet K2-18b has water absorption detected in its atmosphere using data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Herein, we examine whether the reported planetary atmospheric signal seen from HST transmission spectroscopy of K2-18b could instead be induced by time-varying starspots. We built a time-variable spectral model of K2-18 that is designed to match the variability amplitude seen in K2 photometric data, and we used this model to simulate 1000 HST data sets that follow the K2-18b observation strategy. More than 1\% of these provide a better fit to the data than the best-fitting exoplanet atmosphere model. After resampling our simulations to generate synthetic HST observations, we find that 40\% of random draws would produce an atmospheric detection at a level at least as significant as that seen in the actual HST data of K2-18b. This work illustrates that the inferred detection of an atmosphere on K2-18b may alternatively be explained by stellar spectral contamination due to the inhomogeneous photosphere of K2-18. We do not rule out a detection of water in the planet's atmosphere, but we provide a plausible alternative that should be considered and conclude that more observations are needed to fully rule out stellar contamination.},

L 98-59 is a nearby (10.6 pc), bright (H=7.4 mag), M3V star that harbors three small, transiting planets. As one of the closest known transiting multi-planet systems, L 98-59 offers one of the best opportunities to probe and compare the atmospheres of rocky planets that formed in the same stellar environment. We measured the transmission spectrum of L 98-59 c during a single transit, with the extracted spectrum showing marginal evidence for wavelength-dependent transit depth variations which would indicate the presence of an atmosphere. Forward modeling was used to constrain possible atmospheric compositions of the planet based on the shape of the transmission spectrum. Although L 98-59 is a fairly quiet star, we have seen evidence for stellar activity, and therefore we cannot rule out a scenario where the source of the signal originates with inhomogeneities on the host-star surface. While intriguing, our results are inconclusive and additional data is needed to verify any atmospheric signal. Fortunately, additional data will soon be collected from both HST and JWST. Should this result be confirmed with additional data, L 98-59 c would be the first planet smaller than 2 Earth-radii with a detected atmosphere, and among the first small planets with a known atmosphere to be studied in detail by the JWST.},

  abstract = {Aims: TRAPPIST-1 is a nearby ultra-cool dwarf star transited by seven rocky planets. We observed three transits of its outermost planet, TRAPPIST-1h, using the G141 grism of the Wide Field Camera 3 instrument aboard the Hubble Space Telescope to place constraints on its potentially cold atmosphere. Methods: In order to deal with the effect of stellar contamination, we model TRAPPIST-1 active regions as portions of a cooler and a hotter photosphere, and generate multi-temperature models that we compare to the out-of-transit spectrum of the star. Using the inferred spot parameters, we produce corrected transmission spectra for planet h under five transit configurations and compare these data to planetary atmospheric transmission models using the forward model CHIMERA. Results: Our analysis reveals that TRAPPIST-1h is unlikely to host an aerosol-free H/He-dominated atmosphere. While the current data precision limits the constraints we can put on the planetary atmosphere, we find that the likeliest scenario is that of a flat, featureless transmission spectrum in the WFC3/G141 bandpass due to a high mean molecular weight atmosphere ({$\geq$}1000 {\texttimes} solar), no atmosphere, or an opaque aerosol layer, all in absence of stellar contamination. This work outlines the limitations of modeling active photospheric regions with theoretical stellar spectra, and those brought by our lack of knowledge of the photospheric structure of ultracool dwarf stars. Further characterization of the planetary atmosphere of TRAPPIST-1h would require higher precision measurements over wider wavelengths, which will be possible with the James Webb Space Telescope.},

We present simulations of the performance and science yield for a mission and instrument concept that we call the MIR Exoplanet CLimate Explorer, a concept for a moderately sized cryogenic telescope with broad wavelength coverage (1-18 {$\mu$}m) and a low-resolution (R {\textasciitilde} 50) spectrograph designed for the simultaneous wavelength coverage and extreme flux measurement precision necessary to detect the emission from cool rocky planets with PIE. We present exploratory simulations of the potential science yield for PIE measurements of the nearby planet Proxima Centauri b, showing the potential to measure the composition and structure of an Earth-like atmosphere with a relatively modest observing time. We also present overall science yields for several mission architecture and performance metrics, and discuss the technical performance requirements and potential telescope and instrument technologies that could meet these requirements.},

  abstract = {Planets orbiting M-dwarf stars are prime targets in the search for rocky exoplanet atmospheres. The small size of M dwarfs renders their planets exceptional targets for transmission spectroscopy, facilitating atmospheric characterization. However, it remains unknown whether their host stars' highly variable extreme-UV radiation environments allow atmospheres to persist. With JWST, we have begun to determine whether or not the most favorable rocky worlds orbiting M dwarfs have detectable atmospheres. Here, we present a 2.8-5.2 {$\mu$}m JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectrum of the warm (700 K, 40.3{\texttimes} Earth's insolation) super-Earth GJ 486b (1.3 R {$\oplus$} and 3.0 M {$\oplus$}). The measured spectrum from our two transits of GJ 486b deviates from a flat line at 2.2{$\sigma$} - 3.3{$\sigma$}, based on three independent reductions. Through a combination of forward and retrieval models, we determine that GJ 486b either has a water-rich atmosphere (with the most stringent constraint on the retrieved water abundance of H2O {$>$} 10\% to 2{$\sigma$}) or the transmission spectrum is contaminated by water present in cool unocculted starspots. We also find that the measured stellar spectrum is best fit by a stellar model with cool starspots and hot faculae. While both retrieval scenarios provide equal quality fits ( \$\{{\textbackslash}chi \}\_\{{\textbackslash}nu \}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}=1.0\$ ) to our NIRSpec/G395H observations, shorter wavelength observations can break this degeneracy and reveal if GJ 486b sustains a water-rich atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Transmission spectra are differential measurements that utilize stellar illumination to probe transiting exoplanet atmospheres. Any spectral difference between the illuminating light source and the disk-integrated stellar spectrum due to starspots and faculae will be imprinted in the observed transmission spectrum. However, few constraints exist for the extent of photospheric heterogeneities in M dwarfs. Here we model spot and faculae covering fractions consistent with observed photometric variabilities for M dwarfs and the associated 0.3-5.5 {$\mu$}m stellar contamination spectra. We find that large ranges of spot and faculae covering fractions are consistent with observations and corrections assuming a linear relation between variability amplitude, and covering fractions generally underestimate the stellar contamination. Using realistic estimates for spot and faculae covering fractions, we find that stellar contamination can be more than 10{\texttimes} larger than the transit depth changes expected for atmospheric features in rocky exoplanets. We also find that stellar spectral contamination can lead to systematic errors in radius and therefore the derived density of small planets. In the case of the TRAPPIST-1 system, we show that TRAPPIST-1's rotational variability is consistent with spot covering fractions \{f\}\{spot\}=\{8\}-7+18 \% and faculae covering fractions \{f\}\{fac\}=\{54\}-46+16 \% . The associated stellar contamination signals alter the transit depths of the TRAPPIST-1 planets at wavelengths of interest for planetary atmospheric species by roughly 1-15{\texttimes} the strength of planetary features, significantly complicating JWST follow-up observations of this system. Similarly, we find that stellar contamination can lead to underestimates of the bulk densities of the TRAPPIST-1 planets of \{\{{$\Delta$} \}\}({$\rho$} )=-\{8\}-20+7 \% , thus leading to overestimates of their volatile contents.},

The former is currently limited to characterizing young, massive objects while the latter requires near 90{$^\circ$} orbital inclinations, thus limiting atmospheric studies to a small fraction of the total exoplanet population. Here we present an observational and analysis technique for studying the atmospheres of non-transiting exoplanets that relies on acquiring simultaneous, broad-wavelength spectra and resolving planetary infrared emission from the stellar spectrum. This method could provide an efficient means to study exoplanet atmospheric dynamics using sparsely sampled phase curve observations or a mechanism to search for signs of life on non-transiting exoplanets orbiting the nearest M-dwarf stars (such as Proxima Centauri). If shown to be effective with James Webb Space Telescope observations, the method of measuring planetary infrared excess would open up the large population of nearby, non-transiting exoplanets for atmospheric characterization.},

This is achieved by combining several state-of-the-art radiative transfer models, spectroscopic databases and planetary databases (i.e., climatological and orbital). PSG has a 3D (three-dimensional) orbital calculator for most bodies in the solar system, and all confirmed exoplanets, while the radiative-transfer models can ingest billions of spectral signatures for hundreds of species from several spectroscopic repositories. It integrates the latest radiative-transfer and scattering methods in order to compute high resolution spectra via line-by-line calculations, and utilizes the efficient correlated-k method at moderate resolutions, while for computing cometary spectra, PSG handles non-LTE and LTE excitation processes. PSG includes a realistic noise calculator that integrates several telescope/instrument configurations (e.g., interferometry, coronagraphs) and detector technologies (e.g., CCD, heterodyne detectors, bolometers). Such an integration of advanced spectroscopic methods into an online tool can greatly serve the planetary community, ultimately enabling the retrieval of planetary parameters from remote sensing data, efficient mission planning strategies, interpretation of current and future planetary data, calibration of spectroscopic data, and development of new instrument/spacecraft concepts.},
