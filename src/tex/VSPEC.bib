  abstract = {To produce accurate estimates of the line-profile parameters of a model used to represent the spectral features in a solar oscillation power spectrum, it is necessary to (1) select the appropriate probability density function when deriving the maximum-likelihood function to be employed for the parameter estimation and (2) allow for the redistribution of spectral power caused by gaps in the data string. This paper describes a maximum-likelihood method for estimating the model parameters (based on the observed power spectrum statistics) that accounts for redistribution of spectral power caused by gaps in the data string, by convolving the model with the power spectrum of the observed window function. The accuracy and reliability of the method were tested using both artificial and authentic solar oscillation power spectrum data. A comparison of this method with various least-squares techniques is also presented.},

This technique, however, is intrinsically affected by stellar spectral contamination caused by the fact that stellar photo- and chromospheres are not perfectly homogeneous. Such stellar contamination will often reach or exceed the signal introduced by the planetary spectral features.

  abstract = {Transmission spectroscopy of transiting exoplanets is a proven technique that can yield information on the composition and structure of a planet's atmosphere. However, transmission spectra may be compromised by inhomogeneities in the stellar photosphere. The sub-Neptune-sized habitable zone planet K2-18b has water absorption detected in its atmosphere using data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Herein, we examine whether the reported planetary atmospheric signal seen from HST transmission spectroscopy of K2-18b could instead be induced by time-varying starspots. We built a time-variable spectral model of K2-18 that is designed to match the variability amplitude seen in K2 photometric data, and we used this model to simulate 1000 HST data sets that follow the K2-18b observation strategy. More than 1\% of these provide a better fit to the data than the best-fitting exoplanet atmosphere model. After resampling our simulations to generate synthetic HST observations, we find that 40\% of random draws would produce an atmospheric detection at a level at least as significant as that seen in the actual HST data of K2-18b. This work illustrates that the inferred detection of an atmosphere on K2-18b may alternatively be explained by stellar spectral contamination due to the inhomogeneous photosphere of K2-18. We do not rule out a detection of water in the planet's atmosphere, but we provide a plausible alternative that should be considered and conclude that more observations are needed to fully rule out stellar contamination.},

L 98-59 is a nearby (10.6 pc), bright (H=7.4 mag), M3V star that harbors three small, transiting planets. As one of the closest known transiting multi-planet systems, L 98-59 offers one of the best opportunities to probe and compare the atmospheres of rocky planets that formed in the same stellar environment. We measured the transmission spectrum of L 98-59 c during a single transit, with the extracted spectrum showing marginal evidence for wavelength-dependent transit depth variations which would indicate the presence of an atmosphere. Forward modeling was used to constrain possible atmospheric compositions of the planet based on the shape of the transmission spectrum. Although L 98-59 is a fairly quiet star, we have seen evidence for stellar activity, and therefore we cannot rule out a scenario where the source of the signal originates with inhomogeneities on the host-star surface. While intriguing, our results are inconclusive and additional data is needed to verify any atmospheric signal. Fortunately, additional data will soon be collected from both HST and JWST. Should this result be confirmed with additional data, L 98-59 c would be the first planet smaller than 2 Earth-radii with a detected atmosphere, and among the first small planets with a known atmosphere to be studied in detail by the JWST.},

In the range 1.5-141 millionths of a solar hemisphere, the sunspot umbral areas are found to be distributed lognormally. Moreover, the same distribution is obtained for all phases of the solar cycle (maximum, minimum, ascending, descending), as well as for various individual cycles, between 1917 and 1982. Both the mean and the geometric logarithmic standard deviation of this distribution appear to be intrinsically constant over the entire data set; only the number of spots exhibits the familiar solar cycle variations. If the observed lognormal umbral size distribution is not a particular attribute of the sunspot umbras but is instead of a more fundamental property of emerging magnetic flux, then the data would predict a maximum in the size spectrum of photospheric magnetic structures for flux tubes with radii in the range 500-800 km. The absence of solar cycle variations in the relative distribution of umbral areas and especially the lognormal character of this distribution may both argue for the fragmentation of magnetic elements in the solar envelope.},

We calibrate the model with the well-characterized transiting planet, HD 189733b, then compute light curves for seven of the most eccentric transiting planets: Gl 436b, HAT-P-2b, HAT-P-11b, HD 17156b, HD 80606b, WASP-17b, and XO-3b. We present phase variations for a variety of different radiative times and wind speeds. In the limit of instant re-radiation, the light-curve morphology is entirely dictated by the planet's eccentricity and argument of pericenter: the light curve maximum leads or trails the eclipse depending on whether the planet is receding from or approaching the star at superior conjunction, respectively. For a planet with non-zero radiative timescales, the phase peak occurs early for super-rotating winds, and late for sub-rotating winds. We find that for a circular orbit, the timing of the phase variation maximum with respect to superior conjunction indicates the direction of the dominant winds, but cannot break the degeneracy between wind speed and radiative time. For circular planets the phase minimum occurs half an orbit away from the phase maximum---despite the fact that the coolest longitudes are always near the dawn terminator---and therefore does not convey any additional information. In general, increasing the advective frequency or the radiative time has the effect of reducing the peak-to-trough amplitude of phase variations, but there are interesting exceptions to these trends. Lastly, eccentric planets with orbital periods significantly longer than their radiative time exhibit "ringing," whereby the hot spot generated at periastron rotates in and out of view. The existence of ringing makes it possible to directly measure the wind speed (the frequency of the ringing) and the radiative time constant (the damping of the ringing).},

An iterative light curve de-trending approach was used to filter out both astrophysical and systematic variability to detect flares. The flare recovery completeness has also been computed throughout each light curve using artificial flare injection tests, and the tools for this work have been made publicly available. The final sample contains 851,168 candidate flare events recovered above the 68\% completeness threshold, which were detected from 4041 stars, or 1.9\% of the stars in the Kepler database. The average flare energy detected is {$\sim$}1035 erg. The net fraction of flare stars increases with g - I color, or decreasing stellar mass. For stars in this sample with previously measured rotation periods, the total relative flare luminosity is compared to the Rossby number. A tentative detection of flare activity saturation for low-mass stars with rapid rotation below a Rossby number of {$\sim$}0.03 is found. A power-law decay in flare activity with Rossby number is found with a slope of -1, shallower than typical measurements for X-ray activity decay with Rossby number.},

Kepler and TESS find many flaring stars via precise time-domain photometric data, and the frequency and energy distribution of stellar flares on different types of stars are studied statistically. However, the completeness and observational bias of detected flare events from different missions (e.g., Kepler and TESS) vary a lot. We use a unified data processing and detection method for flare events based on the light curves from Kepler and TESS. Then we perform injection and recovery tests in the original light curve of each star for each flare event to correct the completeness and energy of flares. Three samples of flaring stars are selected from Kepler and TESS, with rotation periods from 1 to {\textasciitilde}5 days. Adopting a hot-blackbody assumption, our results show that the cumulative flare frequency distributions (FFDs) of the same stars in Kepler and TESS bands tend to be consistent after correction, revealing a more natural flaring frequency and energy distribution. Our results also extend the low-energy limit in cumulative FFD fitting to 1031.5-33 erg on different types of stars. For solar-type stars, the average power-law index of cumulative FFD ({$\alpha$} cum) is -0.84, which indicates that low-energy flares contribute less to the total flare energy. With a piecewise correlation between {$\alpha$} cum and T eff, {$\alpha$} cum first rises from M2 to K1 stars, then slightly decreases for stars hotter than K1.},

We observed three transits of its outermost planet, TRAPPIST-1h, using the G141 grism of the Wide Field Camera 3 instrument aboard the Hubble Space Telescope to place constraints on its potentially cold atmosphere. Methods: In order to deal with the effect of stellar contamination, we model TRAPPIST-1 active regions as portions of a cooler and a hotter photosphere, and generate multi-temperature models that we compare to the out-of-transit spectrum of the star. Using the inferred spot parameters, we produce corrected transmission spectra for planet h under five transit configurations and compare these data to planetary atmospheric transmission models using the forward model CHIMERA. Results: Our analysis reveals that TRAPPIST-1h is unlikely to host an aerosol-free H/He-dominated atmosphere. While the current data precision limits the constraints we can put on the planetary atmosphere, we find that the likeliest scenario is that of a flat, featureless transmission spectrum in the WFC3/G141 bandpass due to a high mean molecular weight atmosphere ({$\geq$}1000 {\texttimes} solar), no atmosphere, or an opaque aerosol layer, all in absence of stellar contamination. This work outlines the limitations of modeling active photospheric regions with theoretical stellar spectra, and those brought by our lack of knowledge of the photospheric structure of ultracool dwarf stars. Further characterization of the planetary atmosphere of TRAPPIST-1h would require higher precision measurements over wider wavelengths, which will be possible with the James Webb Space Telescope.},

In particular, GPs are frequently employed to account for correlated stellar variability in planetary transit light curves. The efficient application of GPs to light curves containing thousands to tens of thousands of data points has been made possible by recent advances in GP methods, including the celerite method. Here we present an extension of the celerite method to two input dimensions where, typically, the second dimension is small. This method scales linearly with the total number of data points when the noise in each large dimension is proportional to the same celerite kernel and only the amplitude of the correlated noise varies in the second dimension. We demonstrate the application of this method to the problem of measuring precise transit parameters from multiwavelength light curves and show that it has the potential to improve transit parameters measurements by orders of magnitude. Applications of this method include transit spectroscopy and exomoon detection, as well a broader set of astronomical problems.},

  abstract = {Polar faculae are the footpoints of magnetic-field lines near the Sun's poles that are seen as bright regions along the edges of granules. The time variation in the number of polar faculae has been shown to correlate with the strength of the polar magnetic field and to be a predictor of the subsequent solar cycle. Due to the small size and transient nature of these features, combined with different techniques and observational factors, previous counts of polar faculae differ in magnitude. Further, there were no scalable techniques to measure the statistical properties of the faculae, such as the variation of the facular lifetime with time or solar activity. Using data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we present two new methods for tracking faculae and measuring their properties. In the first, we calculate the pixel-by-pixel standard deviation of the HMI continuum intensity images over one day, visualizing the faculae as streaks. The lifetime of the facula is found by dividing the angular length of the streaks by the latitude-dependent rotation rate. We apply this method to the more visible pole each day for a week every six months, from September 2010 to March 2021. Combining all of the measured facular lifetimes provides a statistical distribution with a mean of 6.0 hours, a FWHM of 5.4 hours, and a skew towards longer lifetimes, with some faculae lasting up to 1 day. In the second method, we overlay images of the progressive standard deviation with the HMI magnetogram to show the close relationship between the facular candidates and the magnetic field. The results of this method allow us to distinguish between motion due to the Sun's rotation and "proper motion" due to faculae moving across the Sun's surface, confirming that faculae participate in convective motions at the poles. Counts of polar faculae using both methods agree with previous counts in their variation with the solar cycle and the polar magnetic field. These methods can be extended to automate the identification and measurement of other properties of polar faculae, which would allow for daily measurements of all faculae since SDO began operation in 2010.},

  abstract = {Context. The long and almost continuous observations by Kepler show clear evidence of a granulation background signal in a large sample of stars, which is interpreted as the surface manifestation of convection. It has been shown that its characteristic timescale and rms intensity fluctuation scale with the peak frequency ({$\nu$}max) of the solar-like oscillations. Various attempts have been made to quantify the observed signal, to determine scaling relations for its characteristic parameters, and to compare them to theoretical predictions. Even though they are consistent on a global scale, large systematic differences of an unknown origin remain between different methods, as well as between the observations and simulations. Aims: We aim to study different approaches to quantifying the signature of stellar granulation and to search for a unified model that reproduces the observed signal best in a wide variety of stars. We then aim to define empirical scaling relations between the granulation properties and {$\nu$}max and various other stellar parameters. Methods: We use a probabilistic method to compare different approaches to extracting the granulation signal. We fit the power density spectra of a large set of Kepler targets, determine the granulation and global oscillation parameter, and quantify scaling relations between them. Results: We establish that a depression in power at about {$\nu$}max/2, known from the Sun and a few other main-sequence stars, is also statistically significant in red giants and that a super-Lorentzian function with two components is best suited to reproducing the granulation signal in the broader vicinity of the pulsation power excess. We also establish that the specific choice of the background model can affect the determination of {$\nu$}max, introducing systematic uncertainties that can significantly exceed the random uncertainties. We find the characteristic frequency (i.e., inverse timescale) and amplitude of both background components to tightly scale with {$\nu$}max for a wide variety of stars (about 2-2000 {$\mu$}Hz in {$\nu$}max), and quantify a mass dependency of the latter. To enable comparison with theoretical predictions (which do not include the observed power depression), we computed effective timescales and bolometric intensity fluctuations and found them to approximately scale as {$\tau$}eff {$\propto$} g-0.85T-0.4 and Agran {$\propto$} (g2M)- 1/4 (or more conveniently R/M3/4), respectively. Similarly, the bolometric pulsation amplitude scales approximately as Apuls {$\propto$} (g2M)- 1/3 (or R4/3/M), which implicitly verifies a separate mass and luminosity dependence of Apuls. We have also checked our scaling relations with solar reference values and find them in good agreement. Conclusions: We provide a thorough analysis of the granulation background signal in a large sample of stars, from which we establish a unified model that allows us to accurately extract the granulation and global oscillation parameter. The resulting scaling relations allow a simple estimate of the overall spectral shape of any solar-type oscillator and might serve as a starting point for future large-sample studies or as a reference for theoretical modelling of granulation.},

  abstract = {In the surface layers of late-type stars, stellar convection is manifested with its typical granulation pattern due to the presence of convective motions. The resulting photospheric up- and downflows leave imprints in the observed spectral line profiles. We perform a careful statistical analysis of stellar granulation and its properties for different stellar parameters. We employ realistic 3D radiative hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations of surface convection from the Stagger-grid, a comprehensive grid of atmosphere models that covers a large parameter space in terms of Teff, logg, and [Fe/H]. Individual granules are detected from the (bolometric) intensity maps at disk center with an efficient granulation pattern recognition algorithm. From these we derive their respective properties: diameter, fractal dimension (area-perimeter relation), geometry, topology, variation of intensity, temperature, density and velocity with granule size. Also, the correlation of the physical properties at the optical surface are studied. We find in all of our 3D RHD simulations stellar granulation patterns imprinted, which are qualitatively similar to the solar case, despite the large differences in stellar parameters. The granules exhibit a large range in size, which can be divided into two groups - smaller and larger granules - by the mean granule size. These are distinct in their properties: smaller granules are regular shaped and dimmer, while the larger ones are increasingly irregular and more complex in their shapes and distribution in intensity contrast. This is reflected in their fractal dimensions, which is close to unity for the smaller granules, and close to two for larger granules, which is due to the fragmentation of granules. Stellar surface convection seems to operate scale-invariant over a large range in stellar parameters, which translates into a self-similar stellar granulation pattern.},

This new data-analysis technique, called planetary infrared excess (PIE), holds the potential to open up the opportunity for measuring mid-infrared (MIR) phase curves of nontransiting rocky planets around the nearest stars with a relatively modest telescope aperture. We present simulations of the performance and science yield for a mission and instrument concept that we call the MIR Exoplanet CLimate Explorer, a concept for a moderately sized cryogenic telescope with broad wavelength coverage (1-18 {$\mu$}m) and a low-resolution (R {\textasciitilde} 50) spectrograph designed for the simultaneous wavelength coverage and extreme flux measurement precision necessary to detect the emission from cool rocky planets with PIE. We present exploratory simulations of the potential science yield for PIE measurements of the nearby planet Proxima Centauri b, showing the potential to measure the composition and structure of an Earth-like atmosphere with a relatively modest observing time. We also present overall science yields for several mission architecture and performance metrics, and discuss the technical performance requirements and potential telescope and instrument technologies that could meet these requirements.},

  abstract = {Planets orbiting M-dwarf stars are prime targets in the search for rocky exoplanet atmospheres. The small size of M dwarfs renders their planets exceptional targets for transmission spectroscopy, facilitating atmospheric characterization. However, it remains unknown whether their host stars' highly variable extreme-UV radiation environments allow atmospheres to persist. With JWST, we have begun to determine whether or not the most favorable rocky worlds orbiting M dwarfs have detectable atmospheres. Here, we present a 2.8-5.2 {$\mu$}m JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectrum of the warm (700 K, 40.3{\texttimes} Earth's insolation) super-Earth GJ 486b (1.3 R {$\oplus$} and 3.0 M {$\oplus$}). The measured spectrum from our two transits of GJ 486b deviates from a flat line at 2.2{$\sigma$} - 3.3{$\sigma$}, based on three independent reductions. Through a combination of forward and retrieval models, we determine that GJ 486b either has a water-rich atmosphere (with the most stringent constraint on the retrieved water abundance of H2O {$>$} 10\% to 2{$\sigma$}) or the transmission spectrum is contaminated by water present in cool unocculted starspots. We also find that the measured stellar spectrum is best fit by a stellar model with cool starspots and hot faculae. While both retrieval scenarios provide equal quality fits ( \$\{{\textbackslash}chi \}\_\{{\textbackslash}nu \}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}=1.0\$ ) to our NIRSpec/G395H observations, shorter wavelength observations can break this degeneracy and reveal if GJ 486b sustains a water-rich atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Transmission spectra are differential measurements that utilize stellar illumination to probe transiting exoplanet atmospheres. Any spectral difference between the illuminating light source and the disk-integrated stellar spectrum due to starspots and faculae will be imprinted in the observed transmission spectrum. However, few constraints exist for the extent of photospheric heterogeneities in M dwarfs. Here we model spot and faculae covering fractions consistent with observed photometric variabilities for M dwarfs and the associated 0.3-5.5 {$\mu$}m stellar contamination spectra. We find that large ranges of spot and faculae covering fractions are consistent with observations and corrections assuming a linear relation between variability amplitude, and covering fractions generally underestimate the stellar contamination. Using realistic estimates for spot and faculae covering fractions, we find that stellar contamination can be more than 10{\texttimes} larger than the transit depth changes expected for atmospheric features in rocky exoplanets. We also find that stellar spectral contamination can lead to systematic errors in radius and therefore the derived density of small planets. In the case of the TRAPPIST-1 system, we show that TRAPPIST-1's rotational variability is consistent with spot covering fractions \{f\}\{spot\}=\{8\}-7+18 \% and faculae covering fractions \{f\}\{fac\}=\{54\}-46+16 \% . The associated stellar contamination signals alter the transit depths of the TRAPPIST-1 planets at wavelengths of interest for planetary atmospheric species by roughly 1-15{\texttimes} the strength of planetary features, significantly complicating JWST follow-up observations of this system. Similarly, we find that stellar contamination can lead to underestimates of the bulk densities of the TRAPPIST-1 planets of \{\{{$\Delta$} \}\}({$\rho$} )=-\{8\}-20+7 \% , thus leading to overestimates of their volatile contents.},

In the present review I outline our current empirical knowledge and physical understanding of these fascinating structures.

  abstract = {Field configurations and temperature distributions of axially symmetric fluxtubes are determined on the basis of pressure equilibrium and energy balance of the tubes. The description concentrates on layers below {$\approx$} 600 km above the photosphere; a magnetostatic field, and energy transport by a diffusion process are assumed. It is assumed also that the magnetic field of the tubes prevents convective flow across the field lines, so that only radiative energy exchange between the tube and the convection zone is present. A set of model tubes is presented ranging in size from facular points (150 km) to small pores (1000 km), for different values of the field amplitude and the asymptotic energy flux F0 flowing along the tube from the deeper layers. Radial influx of heat into the tube at the photospheric level influences the temperature in the tube strongly for all these models. For a pore-like tube f0 = 0.25 (similar to the flux from a spot umbra) seems appropriate (F0 in units of the normal photospheric flux). If in the smallest fluxtubes F0 is also 0.25, a comparison of the intensity contrast with observations of facular points indicates that the radius of tubes corresponding to facular points is 50-100 km. In the continuum the structure looks like a depression in the photosphere (similar to the Wilson depression of spots). The magnitude of this depression is {$\approx$} 200 km for pores of 1000 km diameter and {$\approx$} 100 km for facular points. The walls of the hole created by the depression contribute considerably to the contrast of structures observed near the solar limb. It is shown how this contribution may explain the centre to limb behaviour of facular contrast as seen in the continuum, and why the continuum CLV differs so strongly from that in line cores. Over the first 400 km above the photosphere the tube expands by a factor of {$\approx$} 2 for all the tubes calculated.},

  abstract = {To date, the ability for observers to reveal the composition or thermal structure of an exoplanet's atmosphere has rested on two techniques: high-contrast direct imaging and time-series observations of transiting exoplanets. The former is currently limited to characterizing young, massive objects while the latter requires near 90{$^\circ$} orbital inclinations, thus limiting atmospheric studies to a small fraction of the total exoplanet population. Here we present an observational and analysis technique for studying the atmospheres of non-transiting exoplanets that relies on acquiring simultaneous, broad-wavelength spectra and resolving planetary infrared emission from the stellar spectrum. This method could provide an efficient means to study exoplanet atmospheric dynamics using sparsely sampled phase curve observations or a mechanism to search for signs of life on non-transiting exoplanets orbiting the nearest M-dwarf stars (such as Proxima Centauri). If shown to be effective with James Webb Space Telescope observations, the method of measuring planetary infrared excess would open up the large population of nearby, non-transiting exoplanets for atmospheric characterization.},

The Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG) can synthesize planetary spectra (atmospheres and surfaces) for a broad range of wavelengths (UV/Vis/near-IR/IR/far-IR/THz/sub-mm/Radio) from any observatory (e.g., JWST, ALMA, Keck, SOFIA), any orbiter (e.g., ExoMars, Juno), or any lander (e.g., MSL). This is achieved by combining several state-of-the-art radiative transfer models, spectroscopic databases and planetary databases (i.e., climatological and orbital). PSG has a 3D (three-dimensional) orbital calculator for most bodies in the solar system, and all confirmed exoplanets, while the radiative-transfer models can ingest billions of spectral signatures for hundreds of species from several spectroscopic repositories. It integrates the latest radiative-transfer and scattering methods in order to compute high resolution spectra via line-by-line calculations, and utilizes the efficient correlated-k method at moderate resolutions, while for computing cometary spectra, PSG handles non-LTE and LTE excitation processes. PSG includes a realistic noise calculator that integrates several telescope/instrument configurations (e.g., interferometry, coronagraphs) and detector technologies (e.g., CCD, heterodyne detectors, bolometers). Such an integration of advanced spectroscopic methods into an online tool can greatly serve the planetary community, ultimately enabling the retrieval of planetary parameters from remote sensing data, efficient mission planning strategies, interpretation of current and future planetary data, calibration of spectroscopic data, and development of new instrument/spacecraft concepts.},
